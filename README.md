# BeagleBone-IO
BeagleBone Black IO Plugin for [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io).

BeagleBone-IO supports Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4, v5, v6, v7 and 8.

## News & Updates

### April-2017: Major changes for BeagleBone-IO v2.0.0

BeagleBone-IO v2.0.0 is a complete rewrite that fixes a number of
long-standing issues related to support for the Linux 4.4 kernel, support
for the latest versions of Node.js, additional pin support, performance
improvements and improved analog to digital conversion. This results in a
number of **BREAKING CHANGES** which are documented in the
[migration guide](https://github.com/julianduque/beaglebone-io#migrating-from-beaglebone-io-v1-to-v2).
Support for Linux kernel versions prior to 4.4 has been dropped.

## Install

```
npm install beaglebone-io
```

For the best user experience with BeagleBone-IO the recommended Operating
System is [Debian](http://beagleboard.org/latest-images).

## Usage

#### Standalone Usage of BeagleBone-IO

Turn built-in user LED 3 on and log the value of analog input A0 to the
console each time it changes. The BeagleBone Black has row of four built-in
blue LEDs mounted on the board itself. User LED 3 is the LED closest to
Ethernet port. It's possible to try this program without connecting any
hardware to the BeagleBone Black.

``` js
var BeagleBone = require('beaglebone-io');
var board = new BeagleBone();

board.on('ready', function () {
  this.pinMode('USR3', this.MODES.OUTPUT);
  this.digitalWrite('USR3', this.HIGH);

  this.pinMode('A0', this.MODES.ANALOG);
  this.analogRead('A0', function (value) {
    console.log(value);
  });
});
```

#### Using BeagleBone-IO with Johnny-Five

To use BeagleBone-IO with Johnny-Five the johnny-five package needs to be
installed.

```
npm install johnny-five
```

Blink the default LED with Johnny-Five. Built-in User LED 3 is the default
LED. It's possible to try this program without connecting any hardware to
the BeagleBone Black. Note how the `Led` constructor is called without any
arguments. If no arguments are passed to the `Led` constructor Johnny-Five
assumes that the default LED should be used.

``` js
var five = require('johnny-five');
var BeagleBone = require('beaglebone-io');

var board = new five.Board({ 
  io: new BeagleBone()
});

board.on('ready', function () {
  var led = new five.Led();
  led.blink();
});
```

Pulse an LED connected to P8_13 with Johnny-Five.

``` js
var five = require('johnny-five');
var BeagleBone = require('beaglebone-io');

var board = new five.Board({
  io: new BeagleBone()
});

board.on('ready', function() {
  var led = new five.Led('P8_13');
  led.pulse(1000);
});
```

Below are two images of the BeagleBone Black expansion headers from the
[BeagleBone 101](http://beagleboard.org/Support/bone101/).

The header pins that are colored orange in the first image are reserved for
the on-board eMMC storage and HDMI and can't be used with BeagleBone-IO.
Although P9_25 isn't colored orange it's also reserved and can't be used by
BeagleBone-IO.

The following image of the expansion headers shows the GPIO numbers for the
header pins.

## Migrating from BeagleBone-IO v1 to v2

There are two **BREAKING CHANGES** in BeagleBone-IO v2 that need to be taken
into account when migrating from v1 to v2. Both breaking changes can be seen
when the following v1 program

``` js
var BeagleBone = require('beaglebone-io');
var board = new BeagleBone();

board.on('ready', function () {
  this.digitalWrite(12, this.HIGH);
});
```

is compared with its v2 equivalent.

``` js
var BeagleBone = require('beaglebone-io');
var board = new BeagleBone();

board.on('ready', function () {
  this.pinMode('P8_14', this.MODES.OUTPUT);
  this.digitalWrite('P8_14', this.HIGH);
});
```

#### Arduino Pin Numbers

In v1 each pin had a documented Arduino pin number.

| BBB Port | Arduino Pin | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
|P8_14|12|Digital|

In v2 this is no longer the case.

| Pin ID | Supported Modes | Comments |
|:----|:-----|:----|
| P8_14 or GPIO26 | INPUT, OUTPUT | |

In v2 pin IDs should be used in place of Arduino pin numbers. For example,
the following v1 code

``` js
  this.digitalWrite(12, this.HIGH);
```

should be replaced with the following v2 code.

``` js
  this.pinMode('P8_14', this.MODES.OUTPUT);
```

#### Setting Pin Modes Implicitly

The observant reader may also have noticed the addition of the following line
of code to the v2 example code above.

``` js
  this.pinMode('P8_14', this.MODES.OUTPUT);
```

In v1 calling `digitalWrite` implicitly set the mode of the appropriate pin
to OUTPUT. In v2 pin modes are no longer implicitly set. Note that if you
don't call IO Plugin methods like `digitalWrite` directly yourself then
there is nothing to do here as Johnny-Five will explicitly set pin modes
to the appropriate values.
