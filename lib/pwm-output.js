  // accessed without root privileges. It takes udev a while to set the
  // permissions and we need to wait for it to complete its work to avoid
  // EACCES errors. To determine when udev has finished its work we
  // continuously try to access the appropriate files until they are
  // successfully accessed. We stop after 10000 tries. Under normal conditions
  // approximately 200 tries are needed to successfully access the first path
  // in the paths array. The remaining paths can typically be accessed
  // successfully on the first try. On kernels prior to v4.11 the code will
  // actually attempt to access the file 10000 times if Node.js was started
